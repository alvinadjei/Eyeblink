# Eyeblink Experiment

## Overview
This repository contains code and instructions for setting up an eyeblink conditioning experiment in mice. In this case, the conditioned stimulus is a short musical tone, 
and the unconditioned stimulus is a short puff of air to the mouse's eye.

This page is a work in progress, and will be updated as the project progresses.
